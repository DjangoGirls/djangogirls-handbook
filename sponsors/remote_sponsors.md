# Sponsors

Getting sponsors on board may sound scary, but it is not so difficult. In this chapter, we will help you find sponsors and handle money. 

Remember that you cannot use the Django Girls name to obtain sponsorship until your workshop has been approved by us.

If you are hosting a remote workshop, you may not need to approach any sponsors at all, we encourage you to only do so if this is required.
