# Sponsors

Getting sponsors on board may sound scary, but it is not so difficult. In this chapter, we will help you find sponsors and handle money. Remember that you cannot use the Django Girls name to obtain sponsorship until your workshop has been approved by us. Any sponsors approached before approval has been granted should be done so only in order to gain interest in a potential workshop. No funds should be confirmed or received without approval.
