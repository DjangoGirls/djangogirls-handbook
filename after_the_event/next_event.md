# Next event

If you plan to organize next edition of Django Girls in your city, you will need to let us know, so that:

* we know it is happening :\)
* we will setup a new website for you \(with the same address\) - **please do not change old website after the event** - it will cause more extra work for us and we will not have previous events listed nicely on our "Event" page. We also associate some stats after each finished event, so changing you old website will cause trouble for us.

When you're ready to organize another event, [send us an email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) with a date \(precise or just month and year\). As soon as we give you a new website, you'll be able to [edit your team](https://djangogirls.org/admin/core/event/add_organizers/) to remove or add new organizers.

Have fun planning a new event ;\)
