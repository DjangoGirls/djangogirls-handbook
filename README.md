# Projeto de tradução do Django Girls - Manual do Organizador

Este é um fork do projeto de documentação de mentoria das Django Girls, mais especificamente o Manual do Organizador.
O projeto original pode ser encontrado [aqui](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/organizer-manual).

O nosso objetivo é traduzir a documentação para o Português-BR. Caso deseje participar, é importante seguir os seguintes passos:

1. Crie um branch com o nome do conteúdo que pretende traduzir. Esse branch deve partir do _pt-br-translation_.

2. Descreva [nesta planilha](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCe_Rgaxr-kSq5tfjY1BlZ52XR1jM5opfteyFSE8pbk/edit#gid=0) em qual conteúdo você está trabalhando.

3. Os arquivos da raiz do projeto devem ser mantidos em inglês. O conteúdo traduzido deve ser copiado para a pasta pt-br na raiz do projeto, seguindo a mesma hierarquia do projeto em inglês. Isso é necessário pois o nosso objetivo é submeter esta tradução para a documentação original do Django Girls.

4. Ao terminar a tradução, realize um Pull Request para o branch _pt-br-translation_. Atenção para não submeter o seu Pull Request para o projeto original. 

5. Qualquer participante pode validar e aceitar/rejeitar pull requests. Contamos também com a sua ajuda para validar os nossos :)

# Django Girls Organizer's Manual

If you are reading this, it means you are interested in organizing your own Django Girls event. That's awesome!

In this manual we are going to explain to you how Django Girls works, what you need to do and how to get started. So... let's get into details:

## What is Django Girls?

Django Girls is an initiative that is aimed at introducing women who have never coded before to the world of technology and increasing the diversity within the industry.

We do that by organizing workshops and inviting women to join us to learn how to build the internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django in a safe, friendly, inclusive environment.

Our mission is to bring more women into the tech field by making technology more approachable, simpler and friendlier. We provide tools, resources and a community that makes it easier to learn about technology.

## The Basics

### What is a Django Girls event?

A Django Girls event is a one-day workshop with an installation party the evening before or remotely via Google Hangout/Skype. During the whole day participants work in small groups (3 attendees + 1 coach) and go through the tutorial to successfully create a blog application and deploy it to the internet.

Django Girls events are always non-profit and free for participants. We do not pay coaches, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming and there is no age limitation. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

### Philosophy

- __Attendee's experience matters__. When you're learning something new, it is common to get lost or discouraged because it's hard. That's why a helpful and friendly environment matters a lot to the learning experience. Make sure attendees feel like little children in Disneyland, excited to go on an adventure. It's all in the details.
- __Everyone can do it__. Technology is for people and everyone can be a creator. Show the bigger picture and encourage attendees to try new things.
- __It's all about the people__. People are the core of what we do. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about your attendees' experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel awesome.

### Using the Django Girls name

To use the Django Girls name for your workshop, you need to follow these steps:
* apply to organize an event [here](http://djangogirls.org/organize/)
* wait for our response
* we will create a website and e-mail account in our domain
* you can start!

It is very important for us to know about all events that use the Django Girls name. __Please make sure not to use it, unless you contacted us__.
