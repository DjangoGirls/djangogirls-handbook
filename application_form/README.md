# Application process

## Application process

**The goal of Django Girls is to bring new people into technology, especially women. You're free to organize a mixed-gender groups for your event but women must have priority when applying.**

The tutorial is designed for total beginners, so no programming background is needed. Basically, any person with a computer can do it.

However there are some things to look out for. If you organize something for free there is a chance that some people will not appear at all. They didn't invest any time or money, so it is easy for them to simply not come. That's why you should try to find people who really, really care.

The only way you can measure somebody's commitment is their application form. Make sure that it contains questions that will give you necessary hints about the person.

This chapter will cover how to create an application form for your event and how to select attendees.
