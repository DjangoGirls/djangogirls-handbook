# Who to target?

Django Girls events can have different target groups in terms of gender. This is your choice, but the most important is to understand your own choice, and be explicit and consistent in your communication. Common choices for the scope of your workshop are:

- Women
- Women and non-binary people
- People of any gender

## Basic gender terminology

A lot of people are assigned a gender at birth, and continue to identify with that gender - they feel fine about it. These people are called cisgender (or cis women/men). Some people are transgender, which means they do not identify with that gender. Most of these people have been assigned female at birth or assigned male at birth.

There is a wide variety amongst trans people. Some identify entirely as a man or woman, some feel like they belong somewhere in between. The latter group is often called non-binary, but different labels exist. A lot of trans people don't conform to their assigned gender in appearance (their gender expression). They may use a different name, pronouns or change (some of) their body with medical processes. Not all of them do, however. People who have transitioned from man to woman are called trans women, people who transition from woman to man are called trans men.

Many trans and non-binary people encounter difficulties in life, and in entering technology, that are not encountered by cisgender people - especially compared to cis men. Therefore, it can make sense to open your workshop to this wider group.

## Workshops for women

Opening up applications to women, including trans women, is a common choice for Django Girls events. The website defaults to this, but we recommend adding an explicit mention of being trans inclusive. A good way to word this is:

> We are trans-inclusive and welcome applications from anyone who identifies as a woman.

## Workshops for women and non-binary people

Another choice is to be open to women and non-binary people. Non-binary people can be assigned male or assigned female, and can have any range of appearances. Some might present in a way that others will read as them being men or women, some look more ambiguous. This is influenced by personal preference, but also by safety concerns. Therefore, you need to be aware that some attendees may identify as non-binary, yet not look different to you than cis men or cis women.

The Django Girls name and website refer to "women" and "girls" in a few places already, so if you use the phrase "women and non-binary people" on your event page, people are likely to assume that you mean "non-binary people who look like women to the organisers" or "people who are feminine enough in their appearance" or "only assigned female non-binary people". To avoid this, it's important to be very explicit.

A good start for being and appearing inclusive is:

- Early on in your event page, clarify your target group as: “women and non-binary people, regardless of gender expression or assigned gender at birth”
- Consistently using “women and non-binary people” everywhere, and never “women” alone.
- Ask for people’s pronouns for their badge in the application form - this target group means you can’t assume "she" as the default pronoun. This should be optional. If you make name badges, try to print the pronouns on them.

## Workshops for people of any gender

You can also choose to open your event to any applicants, regardless of their gender. However, when you organise an event under the Django Girls name, you must prioritise underrepresented genders, meaning people who are not cisgender men.

To meet this requirement, you will have to ask for the gender of applicants in your application form. Do not restrict this choice to man/woman, as non-binary people generally do not fit in these categories. A good set of choices can be:

- Man
- Woman
- Non-binary/other gender

This allows you to prioritise applications according to this requirement. See the note below about including trans men.

## Including trans men

The examples listed above do not include trans men (people assigned female at birth, transitioned to men). In their past, these people may also have experienced difficulties in entering technology similar to those of women. If you would like to include this group, you could expand your wording to:

> women, non-binary people, and trans men, regardless of gender expression or assigned gender at birth

at least once on your event page, and

> "women, non-binary people, and trans men"

in other mentions on your page. If you ask people about their gender to prioritise, you'll have to make a separate option for trans men to distinguish them.
