# Venue

Before you decide on a venue, try to do a walkthrough to determine which parts
of the venue you'll be using, based on access. Find out what accommodations, if 
any, the venue provides. It might take some pressure off you, and will also give 
you an idea of what is not available. 

- Are there any rooms you can use as quiet/lactation rooms? Quiet rooms should be 
quiet and calm, so that folks can use them to escape noise and bright lights, and 
also comfortably use them for pumping breast milk. 
- How compliant is your venue with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or similar
laws in your country? Is it braille and signage compliant? Are there accessible 
routes to all parts of the venue? 
- What is the temperature differential between outside and inside? Does it tend to be
chilly or warm? If you know this, you can warn people to bring a sweater (or not 
wear heavy clothes).
- Is the floor carpeted? Is the carpet firm? How easy would it be to move a wheelchair 
or walker across the floor?
- If the floor isn't carpeted, is it slippery? 
- Is the venue noisy or echo-y? If your venue is a hotel, will there be music in the lobby? 
Will your attendees be able to work in quiet? 
- Are service animals welcome? Are there grassy areas for them? 
- What do the entrances look like? Is the main entrance wheelchair accessible? 
- Are there ramps with handrails? 
- Are the restrooms accessible? Do they have grab bars and lowered sinks? Are there 
gender-neutral restrooms that are trans-inclusive? 
- Is there accessible parking? 
- Is there adequate lighting for your attendees to work? 
- Is the venue allergy-free and scent-free?  Consider creating a [scent policy](https://portland.adacamp.org/policies/#scent) and asking  attendees to not wear perfume to the event, 
for folks who have allergies, asthma, or are prone to migraines.
