# In-Person Workshops

An in-person workshop is any workshop where participants, coaches, and organisers, all meet in the same physical location. Participants can work together in teams and support from coaches is done face-to-face. 

Due to this, in-person workshops should only be conducted when it is safe to do so, and you may be asked in your application to provide evidence of why you feel this type of worshops is safe, and what, if any, safety measures you will be putting in place.

If you are not sure if it is safe to hold an in-person workshop, you might prefer to organise a remote workshop instead.
