# Swag

This is only if you have the budget.

## Copyrighted materials

If you found an awesome design (picture, font, drawing, etc) you would love to use during your event, **don't forget to check the license**! Only use open source materials or pay for the license. If you can't find the license of something, please don't use it.

## Temporary tattoos!

This is so far the most fun and most affordable way to do something nice at your event. You only need to buy [Temporary Tattoo Paper](https://www.amazon.com/Silhouette-MEDIA-TATTOO-Temporary-Tattoo-Paper/dp/B0043WJ3OA/), print [our ready-to-go designs](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/resources/tree/master/Design/Tattoos) on your home printer, cut them out and you're good to go! You can get a lot of tattoos for just a couple of bucks.

## T-shirts for coaches

Order t-shirts for your coaches as a thank-you gift, but wearing the t-shirts also makes your coaches more visible in the venue. You can find t-shirt designs on our [resources page](../../resources/README.md).

## Tote bags

We like tote bags, right? They are pretty cheap to print and it's a nice gift for your attendees that will remind them about the event later on. You can find designs on our [resources page](../../resources/README.md)

## Stickers

Pssst, [Stickermule](http://stickermule.com/) likes to sponsor events with sticker credit! You can find our [ready-to-print designs here](../../resources/README.md).
