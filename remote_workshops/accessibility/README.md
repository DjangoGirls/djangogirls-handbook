# Accessibility 

We want to make all Django Girls events as accessible as possible. Making your
event accessible will help everyone, not just attendees with disabilities. This 
page can be daunting because we are trying to be comprehensive, but read through 
it and do your best! 

Depending on your situation, you might not be able to do all of these things. But if you 
think about accessibility from the time you decide to organize an event, you
have a better chance of not accidentally leaving groups of people out. So 
here are a few things to consider with respect to accessibility when organizing 
your event. 

Thanks to Stephanie Wheeler, Ph.D. for her help with this guide!
