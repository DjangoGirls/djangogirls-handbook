# Web site and application 

Don't make your attendees ask which accommodations you're able to provide. Be up front about what you're 
able to do! This will encourage people who need those accommodations to apply, since they will be 
confident that they can participate in your event. Being specific with your list of accommodations 
will show potential attendees that you're working to create a space where access and inclusivity are 
priorities. You can add questions in your FAQ section to address any potential concerns. See [this event](http://djangogirls.org/portland) for some suggestions. 

Ask for suggestions from your coaches and attendees on other things you might want to provide. For example, 
you may be able to provide some web cams, microphones or wifi dongles for attendees who do not have access to this at home, or costs towards childcare so attendees with children at home can focus on learning (costs covered by sponsorship).
