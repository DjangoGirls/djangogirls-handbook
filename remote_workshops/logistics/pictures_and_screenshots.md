# Photos

It's a great memory to have some nice photos or a video from the event to show how your workshop went. It also helps to use it as marketing material for your next event, plus you have something to show to the sponsors!

You won't be able to take photos yourself if you're running a remote event, but you can ask attendees to share selfies of themselves participating on your social media or communication channels.

If you want to take screenshots of your video conferencing software during the workshop, don't forget to ask attendees and coaches if they want their picture taken. Make sure only people who have consented are included in any screenshots.

You can also add your event's photos to our [Django Girls albums](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/albums): to do that, [send us an email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and we will grant access to the account for you to upload your images.
