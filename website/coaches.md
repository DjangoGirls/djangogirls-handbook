```

* Don't add a background.
* Check the `Is public` box.
* Save your modifications by clicking on the `save` blue button on the right.
* Click on `Website Contents`.

* Click on the `Save` button at the bottom of the page.

* Look if your coaches aren't already in the drop down menu. If they're not, add them by clicking on the `plus` button. The only field required is the name. If you don't have pictures for your coaches, put Django Girls [logo](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/resources/blob/master/Design/Logo/logo_square.png). Click on save.
* Add as many coaches as you want by clicking on `Add another Eventpagecontent-Coach Relationship`.
* Save your modifications by clicking on the `save` blue button on the right.

If you can't find your coaches on your website, check if `Is public` box of this section is checked.

Once your event is done, you won't be able to edit any of those fields. If you need to do that, please send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com).
