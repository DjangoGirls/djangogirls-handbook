* `Name`, `City`, `Country`, `Page URL`: They represent the name of your event, where it's happening and its website address. You can't edit those fields: if you need to do that, please [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com).
* `Date`: You can edit this field if you need to set a more precise date, postpone or delay an event. If you need to cancel your workshop, keep us posted ;\)

### `Event main picture` section:

`Photo`, `Photo credit`, `Photo link`: Those fields are connected to the cover picture of your event on the [events list page](https://djangogirls.org/events/) of Django Girls website. We already gave you one so you don't need to edit those fields. If you need to change it, only use pictures under Creative Common License and don't forget to update photo credit and link.

### `Event website` section:

* `Title`: It represents the name of your event website.
* `Description`: you can edit or translate this field.
* `Main color`: Don't like orange? Chose another color for your website and enter it here in hex format. Try to chose a color on which white text is still readable.
* `Custom css`: put extra css here.
* `Website is ready`: When you've finished to edit your website content and want to make it live, check this box and click on `Save` in the right menu. Keep in mind that you don't need to do that to test your website: it will always be live for you and people on your organizing team.

Once your event is done, you won't be able to edit any of those fields. If you need to do that, please send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com).
